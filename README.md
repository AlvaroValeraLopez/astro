# My Astro Projects
Welcome to my collection of web projects developed using the Astro.build framework. This repository serves as a showcase of my learning journey and capabilities in web development, featuring a mix of course-based projects and replicas of actual websites. Each project is contained within its own folder, making it easy to explore individual projects.
